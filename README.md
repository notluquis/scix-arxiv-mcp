# research-remote-mcp

Remote MCP server that exposes NASA SciX / ADS and arXiv as tools for Claude (and any other MCP-compatible client that supports remote connectors).

## Why this exists

The original MCP servers for SciX and arXiv are excellent — but they run locally via stdio, which means they only work in desktop clients like Claude Desktop or the CLI. Claude on the web (claude.ai) connects to tools through **remote MCP servers** over HTTP. This project bridges that gap: it wraps both data sources behind a single Streamable HTTP endpoint you can deploy and point Claude at from Settings → Connectors.

```
claude.ai
  └── Custom Connector
        └── https://your-domain.com/mcp
              ├── SciX / NASA ADS   (peer-reviewed astronomy, astrophysics, planetary science)
              └── arXiv             (preprints across all sciences)
```

```

The server is **stateless** — a new MCP server instance is created per request. No sessions, no in-memory state. This keeps deployment simple and makes horizontal scaling trivial. The MCP endpoint supports Streamable HTTP over `GET /mcp` and `POST /mcp`.

## Why Hono

Hono replaced Express v5 as the HTTP layer because:

- **Native `HttpBindings`** — Hono's `@hono/node-server` exposes the raw Node.js `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse` objects that MCP's `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` needs directly, with no adapter layer
- **`RESPONSE_ALREADY_SENT` sentinel** — cleanly tells Hono not to write its own response after the MCP transport hijacks the socket for SSE streaming
- **Zero overhead** — Hono adds no middleware stack, just routes; appropriate for a tight service with two endpoints

## Setup

### 1. Get a SciX API token

Create an account at [scixplorer.org](https://scixplorer.org) and generate a token at `Settings → API Token`.

### 2. Environment variables

```env
SCIX_API_TOKEN=your_token_here   # required
PORT=3000                         # optional, default 3000
MCP_BEARER_TOKEN=secret           # optional, require Authorization: Bearer secret for /mcp
MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://app.example.com,https://claude.ai  # optional extra Origin allowlist
```

If `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is unset, requests without an `Origin` header are allowed and requests with an `Origin` header must match the request host. Set explicit origins in production when the server is behind a known client/proxy.

### 3. Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Deploy to Railway

Connect the repo in Railway and add the `SCIX_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Railway picks up `railway.json` and builds from the root-level `Dockerfile` automatically.

### 5. Add to Claude

In Claude → Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector:

```
https://your-domain.railway.app/mcp
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm install          # install deps
pnpm build            # TypeScript → build/
pnpm test             # run the test suite
pnpm test:watch       # watch mode
pnpm dev              # watch + run (tsx)
```

## Tech stack

- **Hono** + `@hono/node-server` — HTTP server with native Node.js bindings
- **MCP SDK** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` — Streamable HTTP transport (stateless)
- **Zod v4** — schema validation and type inference
- **TypeScript 6.0** / Node.js 22
- **vitest** — test suite across all tools and clients
